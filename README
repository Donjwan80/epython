Epiphany Python
--------------------------
This is an interpreter for Python which will run on the Epiphany chip and allows for common parallel activities such as communication and synchronisation. Full language documentation can be found in the docs folder. Example codes can be found in docs/examples

Installation
-------------------
Type make
If you wish to install it (into the bin directory) then sudo make install

If you do not install it then you can still run ebasic from the current directory, as ./epython.sh but ensure that epython-device.srec is in the current directory when you run the interpreter. The epython.sh script will detect whether to run as sudo (earlier versions of the parallella OS) or not (later versions.)

Hello world
--------------------
Create a file called hello, then put in the line
print "Hello world from core "+coreid

save it, and execute ebasic hello (or ./epython.sh hello if you have not done make install.)

Each core will display the Hello world message to the screen along with their core id

64 cores
--------------
eBASIC has been developed and tested on a 16 core Epiphany machine, if you have a 64 core chip machine then it should work (still on 16 cores), and it should be trivial to edit the source to support the full 64 cores.

Troubleshooting
----------------------------
Often these are set by default, but if it complains that it can not find e-gcc or the libraries, then you will need to set these environment variables:

export PATH=/opt/adapteva/esdk/tools/e-gnu/bin:$PATH
export EPIPHANY_HOME=/opt/adapteva/esdk

(you might want to place this in your .bashrc file)

Rebuilding the parser/lexer
----------------------------------------------
To rebuild the parser and lexer too, then do make full
