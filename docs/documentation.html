<h1>Epiphany Python documentation</h1>
ePython is a subset of python for the Eiphany architecture. It is possible to run code both on physical cores (Epiphany device) and virtual cores (the ARM host) and these can communicate with each other. By default the user code, symbol table and program data are all allocated in core local memory, although this can be selected via language mechanisms and command line arguments.

<h2>Assignment</h2>
Normal variable assignment follows the form <i>identifier=expression</i>, both are which are handled the same. ePython supports integers, real numbers (single precision), strings, booleans and none to be stored in variables. The type of a variable depends upon the current value being stored within it and if the variable does not currently exist then it will be created.
<pre>
a="hello"
b="world"
c=a+" "+b
print c
</pre>
<pre>
a=12
b=2.3
print a
a=a+b
print b
</pre>
<h3>Arrays</h3>
The language supports one dimensional arrays of integers and reals via the <i>dim</i> and <i>sdim</i> statements. The first will allocate the array into the default location (which will be core memory unless overridden by command line arguments) and the second, <i>sdim</i>, will allocate into shared memory which is larger but slower to access. It is also possible to specify a list of values via <i>[v1,v2,...,vn]</i>
<pre>
dim a[100]
i=0
while i<100:
	a[i]=i
	i+=1
</pre>
<pre>
a=[10,20,30,40]
for x in a:
	print x
</pre>
<i>Note: All arrays can be forced into shared memory via supplying -datashared as a command line argument</i>

<h2>Parallelism</h2>
ePython will run the code on each Epiphany core, with each core being independant and having separate values of all data. Cores can communicate via some inbuilt language mechanisms. By default all cores on the Epiphany chip will execute the user code, but this can be selected via the <i>-c</i> command line switch; for instance <i>-c 1</i> will run on core 1 only, <i>-c 1,2,3,4</i> will run on cores 1,2,3 and 4, <i>-c 5:10</i> will run on cores 5 to 10 inclusive and <i>-c all</i> will run on all cores. It is also possible to run code on the ARM host via <i>-h n</i> where <i>n</i> specifies the number of threads, and you can simply specify the number of Epiphany cores active via <i>-d n</i> which will activate <i>n</i> Epiphany cores. Epiphany cores and ARM threads can communicate with each other via the language commands. All these functions are provided in the <i>parallel</i> module which is used by issueing <i>import parallel</i> in your code.
<h3>coreid()</h3>
This function determines the numeric (integer) id of a core or thread. This value can be used to select sections of code to be executed by a subset of the cores (SPMD style) and the integer value can be used in mathematic expressions like any other integer.
<pre>
import parallel
print "Hello world from core "+coreid()
</pre>
<pre>
import parallel
if coreid()==0:
	print "Hello only from core "+coreid()
</pre>

<h3>numcores()</h3>
This expression determines the number of active cores and host threads (integer) that the code was run with.
<pre>
import parallel
print "Number of cores: "+numcores()
</pre>

<h3>Core type</h3>
The <i>ishost()</i> and <i>isdevice()</i> function calls determine whether the current core is a physical one (running on the Epiphany chip) or virtual (running on the ARM host)

<pre>
import parallel
if isdevice():
  print coreid()+" is a physical core"
elif ishost():
  print coreid()+" is a virtual core"
</pre>

You can use the <i>-h n</i> command line argument to determine the number of host (virtual) cores, where n is the number and <i>-d n</i> to determine the number of device (physical) cores. For instance, <i>epython -h 5 -d 5 mycode.py<i> will run this over 5 physical and 5 virtual cores (assuming the code is in a file named <i>mycode.py</i>)

<h3>Point to point communication</h3>
ePython implements P2P communications between specific cores or threads via the <i>send</i> and <i>recv</i> functions. The send function follows the syntax <i>send(expression,  target)</i> where <i>expression</i> is any mathematical expression (including varables and arrays) that hold integers or reals. The <i>target</i> is an integer representing the core id of the target core/thread. The recv function follows the syntax <i>data=recv(source)</i> where <i>data</i> is returned from the call and the data which has been received, and <i>source</i> is the source integer core/thread to receive from. Note that it is only possible to communicate single integers or reals, there is no communication of strings or arrays.
<pre>
import parallel

if coreid()==0:
	send(20,1)
elif coreid() == 1:
	a=recv(0)
	print "Got value "+a+" from core 0"
</pre>

<h3>Sendrecv</h3>
With the <i>sendrecv</i> function the programmer can send some data to and receive from another core in the same statement. Most importantly there is only one blocking point for both of these operations, rather than two if implemented as separate send and recv calls. This is especially useful in halo swapping code.
<pre>
import parallel
a=0
b=0
if coreid() > 0:
	a=sendrecv(coreid(), coreid()-1)

if coreid() < numcores()-1:
	b=sendrecv(coreid(), coreid()+1)
print "Values are "+a+" and "+b
</pre>

<h3>Collective communication</h3>
Two forms of collective communication are supported; broadcasting data and reducing data. The broadcast follows the syntax <i>(expression, root)</i> which will broadcast an expression (a variable, maths expression etc) from the root core with id of <i>integer</i> supplied and each core will store this in the return value.  Note that it is only possible to communicate single integers or reals, there is no communication of strings or arrays.
<pre>
import parallel
print "The random number from core 0 is "+bcast(random%100, 0)
</pre>
A reduction follows the syntax <i>(expression, string operator)</i> where operator is one of <i>"sum"</i>, <i>"prod"</i>, <i>"min"</i> or <i>"max"</i>, the <i>expression</i> (which is often different on different cores) is combined, the operator applied and the result returned from the function and available to all.
<pre>
import parallel
print "The highest random number is "+reduce(random%100, "max")
</pre>

<h3>Synchronisation</h3>
All the active cores can be synchronised via the <i>sync</i> call, where they will all wait at this barrier until every other core has reached a corresponding <i>sync</i> call
<pre>
import parallel
print "Hello from core "+coreid()
sync()
print "After sync from core "+coreid()
</pre>

<h2>Control flow</h2>
Code blocks have their own scope, i.e. if a variable is declared in a block (first seen) then it will only be available to that block and sub blocks.
<h3>Conditional</h3>
ePython implements conditionals via the <i>if</i> statement, the operators == (equality test), != (not equals), < (smaller than), <= (smaller or equals), > (greater than), >= (greater or equals) and is (pointer test.) It is also possible to and expressions together via <i>and</i>, you can also or expressions via <i>or</i>. Note the only operator supported for strings is equality testing. It is possible to combine integers and reals when testing, in such cases integers are tested as floats.
<pre>
import parallel
if coreid()==0 or coreid()==1:
	print "Core id is 0 or 1"
else:
	print "Core id is not 0 or 1"
</pre>

<pre>
import parallel
if coreid()==0:
	print "Core id is 0"
elif coreid()==1:
	print "Core id is 1"
else:
	print "Core id is not 0 or 1"
</pre>
<h3>For loops</h3>
For loops are implemented via the <i>for</i> keyword, and will loop through elements in an array. The <i>range</i> function can be used to create prepacked iterator arrays.
<pre>
import util

for i in range(10):
	print i

for i in range(500, 510):
	print i
</pre>

<pre>
dim a[10]
i=0
while i<10:
	a[i]=10-i
	i+=1

for x in a:
	print "V="+x
</pre>
<h3>Functions</h3>
Python functions are implemented via the <i>def</i> keyword. Default values can be provided to arguments.

<pre>
def adder(a,b):
	return a+b

print adder(10,20)
</pre>

<pre>
def printer(a=0,b=0):
	print "A="+a
	print "B="+a

printer()
printer(22)
printer ("Hello", 10)
</pre>

<pre>
def noneex(a=none):
	if (a is none):
		print "Empty args"
	else:
		print a

noneex()
noneex("HEllO")
</pre>

<h2>Maths</h2>
Maths functions work with both integer and real numbers and variables. There are a number of inbuilt operators for sum (+), minus (-), multiplication (*), divide (/), floor divide (//), modulo (%) and power (^ or **). These can be used in unary fashion, i.e. <i>a+=1</i>. A number of functions are built into the language that provide other maths functionality.

<h2>IO</h2>
ePython provides the <i>print</i> and <i>input</i> functions. These work with integers, reals, booleans and strings. Braces around a print statement are optional.
<pre>
a=input("Enter your name: ")
print "Hello "+a
</pre>
</section>
<hr>
<section>
<a name="misc"></a>
<h2>Miscellaneous</h2>
<h3>Comments</h3>
There are two ways of commenting code. C (<i> /* .... */</i>) spanning multiple lines and (<i>#</i>) comments are supported.
<h3>Exit</h3>
Terminates execution
<pre>
while 1==1:
	a=random % 100
	print a
	if a < 50: exit()
</pre>
</section>
<hr>
<section>
<a name="cmd"></a>
<h2>Command line arguments</h2>
You must provide the filename of the user program (or <i>-l bytecodefile</i> if loading from byte code.) ePython provides a number of command line arguments to manage aspects such as the placement of data, actives cores etc..
