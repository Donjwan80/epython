#Offloading kernels from Python to the Epiphany

The latest version of ePython makes it possible to take existing Python code and offload specific functions (we tend to call them kernels) to the Epiphany cores. From a programming perspective this is very simple to do and get an example up and running which is what we will be looking at in this tutorial.

Before going any further, if you have not yet used or installed ePython then it is worth following the first tutorial ([here](tutorial1.md)) which walks you though installing ePython and running a simple "hello world" example on the Epiphany cores. If you installed ePython a while ago then it is worth ensuring that you are running the latest version, instructions for upgrading are available [here](installupgrade.md)
